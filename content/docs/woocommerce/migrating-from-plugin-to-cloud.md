### Why should I migrate to cloud

 When you are using the Retainful plugin with version 1.x, the abandoned carts management is handled via the wordpress scheduler. All the abandoned cart, recovered cart and in-progress cart entries would be listed on your site's Retainful plugin dashboard. Also, all the mail management occurs within your site. 

While on the other hand, if you migrate to the cloud(option available for existing users if you update the plugin from version 1.x to 2.x), the cart and mail management would be done in the Retainful account dashboard and not on your site. 
So, this would improve the mail handling process significantly. Since we move all the mail handling to the cloud, the site's resources would not be occupied, which would save database space occupancy, thus increasing your site's speed.

### Points to be noted before migration

- [x] 1. The migration option would only be available for users that update the Retainful plugin from version 1.x to 2.x.
- [x] 2. If the version of Retainful plugin you are using is 2.x, then the cart and mail management would automatically be done via cloud. That is, the cart entries and mail templates would be available in your Retainful account and not on your site.
- [x] 3. Once you migrate to cloud, the upcoming abandoned carts, in-progress carts and recovered carts would be recorded and managed in your Retainful account only. Only the Next order coupons and premium features would be listed on the plugin on your site's backend.

### Prerequisites

While using Retainful 2.x, the mail delivery is done with encryption, for security purposes. So, please make sure that your site's server has encryption library enabled.

### Migration from version 1.x to 2.x

**Step-1: Upgrading from version 1.x to 2.x:** 

The migration option would be available if you update from Retainful version 1.x to 2.x as mentioned before. Hence, the first step is to update the plugin version from 1.x to 2.x
1. A one-click update option would be available on your store's plugin manager if you have connected the store with your Retainful plugin. If you haven't connected the store with your account yet, you could do so by clicking <link-text url="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here<link-text>.
2.  Once you connect the store with Retainful account, navigate to your Plugin manager(Woocommerce->Plugins->Installed plugins). You would find an update button below Retainful- Abandoned carts as shown below:

3. Click on the Update button to Update the plugin to version 2.0.
