A store logo is the symbol of your brand. Make sure they get a place in your abandoned cart recovery templates. A logo on the emails is a gentle reminder of your brand.

With Retainful, you could add your Store's logo anywhere on the Abandoned cart emails that you send. This article walks you through the process of adding a logo on your Recovery mail templates.

### For legacy version- 1.x:

Users who have Retainful version 1.x on their site can follow the below process to add a store logo to your Abandoned cart mails.

1. Navigate to Woocommerce->Retainful-Abandoned carts -> Email templates-> Choose a template or create one ->Insert a template.

2. Now, this is a static logo which can be swapped with your store's logo.
3. To remove this logo, place the cursor on the logo element and you would see a list of options popup. Click on the X mark to remove the existing default logo.

4. Post removing the logo, click on the **Add media** button above the Mail body editor as indicated in the above screenshot.
5. Once you click on the Add media button, a popup would come up where you could upload an image or use an existing one. Select one and click one on the **Insert into post**.

2. Click on Emails ->Choose a template or add a new template.
3. Double click on the header image available by default on the template.
