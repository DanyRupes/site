Customizing your abandoned cart email templates has never been so easy. With Retainful, you could easily drag and drop the desired elements onto the template body of your mails.

This article illustrates how you could customize email templates using Retainful.

### Customizing email templates

Login to your Retainful account. Click on **Emails->Email templates->Choose a template or create a new one**.

#### Adding a new block

At the email template layout, you could see a pre-defined template. The tools for customisation are available at the far right corner of the Retainful dashboard as follows:

1. **Section tab**\- In this part, you can find tools that allow you to add segments to your email template, for example, if you wish to divide the template layout into 2 or 3 columns, you could drag and drop blocks from this section.

You could also customise and add styles to the individual sections of the email template. Let us learn more about this on the next section.

#### Editing individual elements of the email 

If you wish to apply styles like changing the color, font-size, dimensions of a particular section, that can be done by clicking on that particular segment. 
When you click on a particular segment, a blue rectangle appears around the element or block. 
And the options to customise the layout appear on the right corner.

1. Choose the block of the element you wish to customize further. A blue rectangle would appear.

2. **Settings block** -This part offers options corresponding to the block that has been chosen. For example, if you click on a button block, then in the settings tab, you can specify the URL to which the user should be redirected to while clicking on the button.
