## What is an abandoned cart?

Imagine you are running an online Shopify store. Your customers are actively adding products to their Shopify carts. But not everyone ends up buying those products. They just leave it in the cart.

An online shopping cart with products that have been selected by the customer but has not yet been bought is an abandoned cart.

## What are the reasons for cart abandonment?

When they are waiting for reasons like;

-   Expecting discounts, free shipping, gifts, add-ons, coupons

-   Thinking about buying it later

-   Would not like to miss out on the product

-   Interested in similar products

-   An error in the website or payment gateway

-   Security concerns related to payment and data

-   Hassle in return

There can be still more reasons but we need to prioritize and address the most obvious ones.

The first two reasons highlighted are the most important reasons. Trying to rectify them can yield great results.

The first reason talks about forgetting the product in the cart and the solution for this is reminding them.

The second reason revolves around cutting the cost and so giving offers and coupons can benefit.

So we have to figure out how do we convert reminders into attractive content which gets clicked and converted to revenue.

## What is an abandoned cart recovery email?

You have abandoned carts and you intend to recover them. So you decide to <link-text url="https://www.campaignrabbit.com/blog/grow-your-ecommerce-store-with-9-effective-automated-emails" rel="noopener" target="_blank">send reminder emails</link-text>.

A reminder email sent to customers who did not end up checking out products added to their shopping carts is an abandoned cart recovery email.

###  Why is it necessary to send abandoned cart r  ecovery email?

### How many abandoned cart recovery emails should I send?

While setting up your abandoned cart recovery email series, do not stop with just one reminder email. Send a series of emails at regular intervals thereby reminding them, again and again, enabling them to buy.

At the same time make sure that you do not spam them with a lot of emails. Also, do not waste the potential of your emails.

While you send a series of emails, consider the following aspects.

-   Email content

-   The time gap between one email with the next

-   Total number of emails

-   The product image or video if any

-   Exact product info

-   Adding details about the product demand

-   <link-text url="https://www.flycart.org/blog/wordpress/social-proof-role-in-ecommerce-conversion"   rel="noopener" target="_blank">Social proofs</link-text>/Social media links

-   Stock availability

-   Offers available now for the product

## Best email series for abandoned cart recovery

Neither end up sending too many emails nor too little for abandoned cart recovery. Most importantly, see to that if the following factors are covered in cart recovery of your email series.

1.  Reminder

2.  Brand value

3.  Scarcity

4.  Discount

### Email Content

“Content is the king.”

No matter what exciting offers you provide. No matter what strategy you use for marketing. One bad email can ruin everything. So do pay attention to what you write in your cart recovery emails.

### Subject

The most important part of a cart recovery email is the subject line.  <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/13-best-subject-lines-for-abandoned-cart-email-campaigns"   rel="noopener" target="_blank">A catchy subject line</link-text> increases the probability of it getting clicked and opened. While a less attractive or underplaying subject might not even secure a click! So try to market your product right here. Do mention the customer’s name for a better response.

### Body

Convey everything that you wanted but never write too much. Concentrate on the placement and the number of occurrences of Call-To-Action(CTA). Do not provide too much as well as too few CTAs. Do not miss out on anything you wanted to convey at the same time, keep it crisp. At the same time try to keep the design attractive.

### Single Click buttons

Make sure you provide single-click buttons that link to the cart, landing page, website or a video. Furthermore, always provide CTA as a bold single click option.

So the above email is just a reminder email for abandoned cart recovery. Is that enough?

Did you know? Just a notification or a reminder could do wonders by recovering abandoned carts. So never miss out on this “just notify” part of abandoned cart recovery emails.

Mention the customer name and product name in both the subject line and email content. Also, give the product image. Provide the CTA link either on the right side or below the product image.

**Reminder**

The entire set of abandoned cart recovery email series is certainly reminders emails. They can be specially designed for increased abandoned cart recovery. But when you start sending abandoned cart recovery email on the same day or a few hours post abandonment, dedicate a mail just reminding your customer.

Let us hope that works out and no need for further emails, as reminder emails stops immediately after checkout. Further plain notification email helps you track the performances of reminders over other addons and strategies used for cart recovery.

Here in the above example, do you notice anything signifying brand value?

“JCREW” which is the name of the brand is mentioned in a crystal clear fashion. Adding the brand name makes it familiar and it is the first step towards establishing brand value. Further links to its social media posts and pages can make people follow, interact by which you can try to establish your brand.

No matter how big or small, develop your brand value. Recognition and trust developed through brand is the greatest asset for a company. Approximately 59% of customers would prefer to buy products from familiar brands. Therefore make your brand familiar with a solid brand building process.

#### 3rd Email template

![3rd Email template](../images/how-to-send-successful-abandoned-cart-email-series/Email-series-template-recovery-3.png)


**Sending day:** 2-3 days post cart abandonment

Here in the above template, there is a mention about stock availability

The number of products left implies product scarcity. That product being selected by other customers implies product demand. Further, a bold text indicating cart is available for checkout in spite of it’s high demand. These can considerably increase the scope of the customer buying it.

**Scarcity**

“Rarity makes gold to be valued as gold.”

Imagine a scenario where gold is available wherever you dig. Will it be costly or valuable as it is today?

No, right?

Similarly, you have to make your product appear valuable so that customers do not want to miss it when it is available.

Address cart abandonment recovery issues by including scarcity marketing strategies like the following.

-   Give updates about how many of that product is available in stock?

-   How many customers have brought it so far?

Offer is the highlight in the above template

Offer value and the text is mentioned very boldly. Moreover the entire focus of the content shifts towards the offer. A randomly generated coupon code is mentioned. This can be used once and applies directly to the cart. The direct application of the coupon to the cart signifies that the code need not be copy-pasted during checkout.

Discounts are delightful if you plan to shop. Discounts will even give you reasons why you need to shop. A price-drop is the reason to shop even when you do not plan to shop.

You can expect loyalty only if you incentivize your customers.

Using discounts and Coupons you can also motivate customers to purchase repeatedly at your store. You can start building your customer base with the help of discounts.

**Sending day:** after 1 week of cart abandonment

**Noticed the timer in the above template?**

Adding validity to the offer fastens cart recovery rates. Mention the existence of timer, both in the subject and body of the email along with the coupon code. The number of buyers will tremendously increase during the limited offer period is a well-known fact.

**Urgency**

Did you know?

Food products and groceries face the least abandonment rates.

You know why?

They face dire necessity and mostly needed urgently.

But when it comes to other items like luxury items customers do not feel that the product is urgently required. So as a result buying gets procrastinated. This results in high rates of abandoned carts.

Urgency marketing tactics avoid procrastination in buying. There is an urge that has to be created to get things done. So try to convince your customers that this is the right time to buy by triggering FOMO. Basically, the “Fear Of Missing Out” strategy will motivate customers to check out abandoned carts sooner.

----------

## Summary

While designing your abandoned cart email series never compromise on the content and design. Though there are specific emails where you focus on various factors like brand name, scarcity, stock availability, fear of missing out; do not fail to mention the essential elements like CTA, product image, social media links, and certain other important contents.

So as a final piece of advice there are simple rules to flourish with recovered abandoned carts.

1.  So if you take a keen look you can realize that the first email in the series is just a reminder email with no other add ons.

2.  Then the second one is advertising and social proofs where you try to make customers notice your brand as well as gain some trust & interest.

3.  The third one emphasizes the scarcity of the product trying to ascertain the supply and demand by letting you know about the stock availability.

4.  The fourth email concentrates on discounts because customers would be convinced to buy if you surprise them with a price drop.

5.  The fifth one goes a step ahead by motivating the customers to buy the product as soon as possible.
