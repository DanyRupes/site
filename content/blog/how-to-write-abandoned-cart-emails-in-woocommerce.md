So, how to write irresistible abandoned cart emails?... How to make your customer click open and read the cart recovery email?

Following are the tips to write best abandoned cart emails (explained with abandoned cart email examples)

### What should be included in your cart recovery email? - Abandoned Cart Recovery Email Checklist
____


#### Catchy Subject Line

Whatever be your email content, your customer is not going to open the abandoned cart email if the email subject line is like “You Left Something in the cart”.

How well you write the abandonment cart email’s subject line is what makes your customer click open the email. You got to tempt customers to check what’s in the email with catchy subject lines.  

Don’t be sending cart emails with subject line saying You left something..., Hurry..., You missed something… People are tired of seeing such patterns in email subject lines.

Instead, choose to appreciate your customer selection, express your concern to help and make your email subject line, the best line in your entire cart email.

***Sample abandoned Cart email Subject Lines:***  
  
Subject Line 1- We’ve Saved it for You!     
Subject Line 2- Can We Help?      
Subject Line 3- You got an Amazing sense of Fashion!

Well, look how caring ‘Casper’ has made the email subject line. “Come back to Bed” sounds caring and no customer leaves this abandoned cart email unopened coz’ it has an emotional connect.


#### Show the customer what’s left in the cart
<br>
Well, you can absolutely track and <link-text url="https://www.retainful.com/blog/how-to-check-abandoned-carts-in-woocommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check abandoned carts in your WooCommerce</link-text> store. But your customer may not actually remember the date of cart abandonment or what’s left in the cart.

So, make sure your cart recovery email reminds customer of what’s left in the cart. Showing the abandoned cart items should be the primary content in any abandoned cart email.

Look how ‘Ashford’ effectively used the email space to show the abandoned cart item. It’s obvious that this part showing the abandoned cart itmes gets the maximum customer attention.

<br>
#### Single-click Checkout (Call to action button)

The abandoned cart emails you send aren’t just for reminding customers about abandoned carts. But actually to make the customer complete the abandoned purchase this time.

Who knows, the reason for your customer to abandon the shopping cart in the first instance may be because of a complex checkout process.

So, don’t add much complexity with the Call to action buttons provided in your abandoned cart emails. Add a fast, single-click checkout button that directly takes customers to the checkout page.   
<br>

  ‘Michael Stars’ adds only two Call to action buttons in the above cart recovery email.
-   Return to your cart- to take customers to the cart page so that he can add or remove products before checking out.
-   Checkout Now- to take customers directly to the checkout page where the customer is just asked to complete payment.
  
#### Tempt with discounts & Free Shipping

Ever asked customers the reason for cart abandonment?
Well, here’s what Statista has got to say when it comes to Why People abandon shopping carts.  
You can clearly see that the majority of people abandon shopping cart when they get no coupon discounts and see high shipping charges on the checkout page.

So, what if the customers are shared with FREE shipping coupons and discount offers along with the cart recovery emails? In this case, you are providing a valuable solution for your customers to recover abandon carts.

‘Nordstorm’ had done a clean cart recovery email copy & makes pretty sure that the free shipping discount is highlighted (Green Text box).

#### Share Support Details

Sometimes your customer might have few queries regarding the product delivery, return policy, coupon restrictions, etc. and because of that could have abandoned cart.

In this case, you got to make sure that every query of your customer is answered. And that’s done by sharing the support details in the WooCommerce abandoned cart email.

![Poppin](../images/How-to-write-abandoned-cart-emails-for-your-WooCommerce-store/d0bee3ef-b56b-4f8a-a56e-69a98d310756.jpeg)

I guess ‘Poppin’ is pretty obsessed to offer excellent customer support. Look how casual they write the support column in their cart email. Also, the support details they share shouldn’t be missed reading- it includes the support number, support availability (work timing), and email address to send feedbacks.

Complete. Isn’t it?

#### Add Customer reviews

Online shoppers are always obsessed with social proof. They look for product reviews before making an online purchase.

And when a business shares social proof (customer reviews and testimonials), the credibility on the product and the trust in the company grows tall. In fact, Social Proofing is one among the list of [17 Growth hacks to grow online business](https://www.campaignrabbit.com/blog/how-to-easily-to-grow-your-online-business-17-growth-hacks).

Its ‘Casper’ again.
