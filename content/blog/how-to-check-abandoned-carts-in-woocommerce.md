    While the first two are self-explanatory, the third type- In progress cart is an exclusive Retainful feature.    
- The in-progress cart or live cart shows the list of online carts that are being actively shopped at that particular moment.   

Also… you can retrieve a lot of useful data with which you can plan your cart recovery email strategy.
- Cart Status says whether the cart is abandoned, recovered or live. Interestingly, the color given to each cart status makes it much simpler to identify the cart types.
- Cart Expired date- The success of every cart recovery email campaign depends on how often you send the cart recovery email reminders. Getting to know when the cart abandonment date helps to <link-text url="https://www.campaignrabbit.com/blog/grow-your-ecommerce-store-with-9-effective-automated-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schedule and automate your recovery email campaigns</link-text>.
