Email marketing is one of the cheapest ways to allure customers and it is the same with getting back customers who have abandoned their carts when shopping online. Abandoned cart email campaigns always do well when planned the right way.

If that impresses the customer, then there is no looking back. Open rates will soar high followed by returning customers.

**Sent by:** 100% Pure

This one is just plain you might wonder. Notice the personalization? It does create some magic. When it is personal, it tends to feel like the initiation of a real conversation. The brand, 100% PURE, is thankful and it seems obvious that there is some surprise waiting in the email which makes a customer click.

The mention of the brand name in the abandoned cart email subject line too sets high expectations for the customer, acting as a bait to get tricked into clicking the email open.

According to yourdictionary.com, exclamatory marks were originally called the ‘note of admiration’. No wonder why people pause when they read a sentence with an exclamation mark because of which<link-text url="https://www.unific.com/abandoned-cart" rel="noopener nofollow">29% of marketers used ‘!’ in the subject line</link-text> according to Unific.

Estée Lauder put this into practice to create their abandoned cart subject lines. The above subject line conveys a ‘do or die’ message and the exclamation is the one that reinforces it. With the mention of the free gift, it would be absurd if people don’t click open this email.

**Sent by:** AYR

The tick of a clock literally pumps the heart at a faster pace. Similar is the purpose of a countdown which generates fear - the Fear Of Missing Out, dearly called FOMO.

AYR is a US-based clothing store known for denims meant for women. The store has used this abandoned cart email subject line to convert more of their visitors into customers.

<h3><highlight>9.</highlight> Still Deciding? Your Dolce & Gabbana Three-Button Wool Blazer Is Waiting!</h3>

**Sent by:** The RealReal

It could have been just ‘Still Deciding?’ to make it short and sweet like a little nudge. Why should the product name be there?

The answer is this. The RealReal is an online store that sells out clothes and accessories from various brands and designers. So, it is a necessity to let the customer know the product in the abandoned cart. In addition, it also acts as a reminder to entice the customer into completing the checkout.

<h3><highlight>10.</highlight> Your Cart’s Loaded & Ready To Go - Free Shipping. No Minimum.</h3>

**Sent by:** Under Armour

People are obsessed with offers and when there is one they never let go.

With this in mind, Under Armour has done it right by mentioning ‘Free Shipping’ in the subject line. The point here is that the subject line indicates the reward that the customer gets for proceeding to checkout. This can never go wrong.

<h3><highlight>11.</highlight> Heading out without checking out? </h3>

**Sent by:** Huckberry

Rhyming words never fail to catch a person’s attention and Huckberry has used this element in the subject line of an abandoned cart email. Some marketers term this as the ‘oops approach’.

This kind of subject line is useful when the customer is assumed to have been interrupted during the checkout process. To say in detail, the cart is abandoned when the attention of the customer is diverted due to some other issue that is unrelated to the shopping done. In such cases, this subject line is the right one to go for.

In reality, it is not possible to do this research separately for each customer and so the abandoned cart email with such a subject line is usually sent as the first one in the cart recovery campaign.

<h3><highlight>12.</highlight> The price dropped for something in your cart</h3>

**Sent by:** Target

Customers go on a shopping spree when the prices hit the lowest mark, be it the bricks and mortar store or online. A price drop, without mentioning the rate of reduction, is a good way to get customers back into the store.

The 8th largest retailer in the US, Target, uses this tactic to increase the open rates and get people shopping again for what they like.

**Sent by:** Happy Socks

Happy Socks nails their abandoned cart email with the subject line which is short yet classy and creates a sense of urgency. It is a way of conveying that the product in the cart is in high demand and there is hardly any time left to grab the stuff.
